 Numerical summaries of the data, such as the sample mean,
standard deviation, percentiles, and autocorrelations, should also be computed
and evaluated. Chapter 2 will provide the necessary background to
do this. If potential predictor variables are available, scatter plots of each
pair of variables should be examined. Unusual data points or potential
outliers should be identified and flagged for possible further study. The
purpose of this preliminary data analysis is to obtain some “feel” for the
data, and a sense of how strong the underlying patterns such as trend and
seasonality are. This information will usually suggest the initial types of
quantitative forecasting methods and models to explore.
